# >Attention, draft below!<

--> [Website](https://smart-football-table.github.io/)

## Overview

TODO make it clickable and with more detail

1) Getting started
2) The actual solution
3) Why this project
4) Next steps

## Getting started

#### Requirements

###### Software
* Docker
* OpenCV
* for YOLO: CUDA & darknet (read more [here](https://github.com/KingMus/smart-football-table-detection/tree/master/yolov3))

###### Hardware
* Soccer Table (our table: Vector3)
* Camera (TODO describe which one and what to avoid...)
* Something to hold the camera over the table (TODO explain possible solutions and our thing)
* LED strip
* 3D-printed camera holding (TODO upload 3dmodels in this repo)
* GPU
* dont forget enough cable

TODO deliver a shopping list for different cases and/or our solution/recommendation for this

#### Build and run
Clone this repository using --recurse-submodules switch (```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/smart-football-table/smart-football-table.git```. After cloning run ```git submodule foreach git checkout master``` once. For the periodic updates run ```git pull && git submodule foreach git pull origin master```. 

TODO use docker in detection or explain how to start this here

## The actual solution

## Why this project?

TODO

## Ideas to implement

###### general
* configuration
  * Camera size/height and the resulting frame size
  * football table values
  * Buttons on table kicker for new game (reset and start) and end game (close and evaluate)
* own account
  * after a single registration, register with the NFC chip at the kicker (position-related)
  * create statistics (see above)
* LED
  * for possession of the ball in team colour
  * goal seems to happen?
* Replay of special events
* Livestream of Video
* Idle for UI (Diashow, Best Moments, etc)

###### related to player
* Wins/Loss
* Wins in combination with position
* average ball possession
* Goals in combination with position
* shot velocity
* prevented goals
* Wins in combination with other player
* Wins in combination with daytime
* [...]

###### related to game
* Result
* Ballpossession in combination with team
* Heatmap
* Metadata (which players, daytime)
* Ballpossession in combination with player
* Ballpossession in combination with soccer figure
* Goals who/where
* average ball velocity
* prevented goals/site
* [...]

###### related football table
* which team wins more often
* average ball velocity
* Goals in combination with position
* when is played
* Metadata (price, size values, ...)
